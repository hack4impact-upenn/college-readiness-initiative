/**
 * Scramjet main exports expose all the stream classes and a number of methods.
 * 
 * All scramjet streams allow writing, reading or transform modes - currently
 * exclusively (meaning you can't have two at once). Any of the scramjet streams
 * can be constructed with the following options passed to mimic node.js standard streams:
 * 
 * * `async promiseTransform(chunk)` - transform method that resolves with a single output chunk
 * * `async promiseWrite(chunk)` - write method that that resolves when chunk is written
 * * `async promiseRead(count)` - read method that resolves with an array of chunks when called
 * 
 * See {@link https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_api_for_stream_implementers node.js API for stream implementers for details}

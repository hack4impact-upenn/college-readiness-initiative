# Scramjet 3.x

The intreface is still the same as previous 2.x version, but now Scramjet is plugin based.

The core features have been moved to [scramjet-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scramjet-core) module. This is a base
for plugin development.

Scramjet itself now consitst of most common plugins and extends core.

## Scramjet 3.1.0

Added new methods (with the dependecy to `scramjet-core v3.2.0`):

* `while` - ends the stream as soon as the condition returns a falsy value (no more items will be processed)
* `until` - works the other way around

Test now also checks if files lint properly.

## Scramjet 3.0.0

Initial release of Scramjet 3.

# Scramjet 2.x

* The interface for the following classes is now considered stable:
  - ```DataStream```
  - ```StringStream```
  - ```BufferStream```
  - ```MultiStream```
* This means that no already existing method will change the interface and
  essentially the current protocol will be backwards compatible.
* Relicensed to the MIT License

## Scramjet 2.12.0

* Added possibility to assign an object
* Fixed assign not to mutate the object passed in callback
* Added tests for assign
* Fixed Node v8.0.0 compatibility (by filtering undefined chunks)

* DataStream.fromIterator now allows asynchronous operations (by returning a promise)
* The promised plugins doc is here. :)

## Scramjet 2.11.0

* Added whenRead and whenWrote methods docs (meaning that as of 2.11 they're fully supported).
* Renamed group to separate, an alias still exists though...
* Promised plugins will be documented in more detail in 2.11.1

## Scramjet 2.10.0

scramjet.plugin interface added for plugins. More docs to come in 2.10.1.

New methods!

* StringStream::append - appends anything to every chunk
* StringStream::prepend - prepends anything to every chunk
* DataStream::unshift - writes some chunks at call time
* DataStream::flatten - a shorthand for flattening chunks which are arrays
* DataStream::batch - batch aggregation of chunks by length

Examples yet to come.

## Scramjet 2.0.0

# Scramjet 2.x

* The interface for the following classes is now considered stable:
  - ```DataStream```
  - ```StringStream```
  - ```BufferStream```
  - ```MultiStream```
* This means that no already existing method will change the interface and
  essentially the current protocol will be backwards compatible.
* Relicensed to the MIT License

## Scramjet 2.11.1

* Fixed default encoding of StringStream to "utf8"
* DataStream.fromIterator now allows asynchronous operations (by returning a promise)
* The promised plugins doc is here. :)

* Renamed group to separate, an alias still exists though...
* Promised plugins will be documented in more detail in 2.11.1

## Scramjet 2.10.0

scramjet.plugin interface added for plugins. More docs to come in 2.10.1.

## Scramjet 2.6.1

Fix regression on StringStream::match.

## Scramjet 2.6.0

New methods!

* DataStream::flatten - a shorthand for flattening chunks which are arrays

Examples yet to come.

  control it to follow
* Fixed a bug causing not raising exceptions properly

## Scramjet 2.1.1

* better docs and autogenerated readme

version in code is identical to 2.0.0 and future releases in the next major
will still be backwards compatible.

    the streams)
* Document MultiStream add/remove methods
* Enforce stricter jshint

## Version 1.4.2
